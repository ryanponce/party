# Party

This prject contains a barebones React + TypeScript project. It used Parcel as the bundler. The real unique thing included in this starter project is the use of [TypeStrict](https://github.com/krzkaczor/TypeStrict) for the linter.

It only contains a single script to run the project, which is `yarn start`. The rest is up to you. You do you.

If you want some more niceties for TypeScript, check [this project](https://github.com/fathyb/parcel-plugin-typescript) out.
